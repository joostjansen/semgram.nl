Description: A Dutch language adaptation of the 'semgram' package for extracting 
    semantic motifs around entities in textual data. It implements an entity-centered 
    semantic grammar that distinguishes six classes of motifs: actions of an entity, 
    treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an 
    entity, characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity. Motifs are 
    identified by applying a set of extraction rules adapted for Dutch syntax and 
    Universal Dependencies annotation to a parsed text object that includes 
    part-of-speech tags and dependency annotations - such as those generated by 
    'spacyr' with Dutch language models (nl_core_news_sm/md/lg). This package adapts 
    the original English-language 'semgram' package by Stuhler (2022) 
    <doi:10.1177/00491241221099551> to handle Dutch dependency labels (UD style), 
    Dutch-specific syntactic constructions (V2 word order, separable verbs, 
    'door'-passives), and Dutch lemmas.
